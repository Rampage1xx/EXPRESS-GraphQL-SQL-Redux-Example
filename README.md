# PinIT
### Pininterest clone made with GraphQL! <br/>
### Requires docker. <br/>
- Share the project folder on docker
- Insert the social keys in ./Backend/Config/keys.ts 
- npm run setup 
- npm start 
- browse to localhost:80
### Core things still missing:
- Improved file structure to accomodate the new features
- Docker Swarm
- Perhaps a better nginx conf
- Some types
- Pretty CSS (zero creativity right now :boom:)
<br/>🐳 Work In Progress 🐳

### Coming Soon™ (wish I had an infinte day)
- Friends network
- Socket.IO chat
- Video Chat
- perhaps more
